# Practice some CSS

Download this directory to your computer (or fork it!) and follow the directions in the comments on the style sheet to complete the assignment.

This webpage was created to help you practice altering CSS like you would in the real world, i.e. making tweaks to existing code. The webpage structure is modeled after the structure of the TwentyTwelve Theme in WordPress. Note how there are several containers, or divs, stacked inside one another. The CSS gives them all different colors so you can visuallize what you're seeing in the HTML code.

It's important to constantly be switching back and forth between your code and your browser so that you can see how your tweaks are actually showing up. For a MUCH more efficient method than using your mouse, visit the "Doing Well In This Class" post that you were ~~forced~~ overjoyed to put on your new website for the other part of homework.
